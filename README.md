# MS-COCO-ES

## Description

MS-COCO-ES is a dataset created from the original [MS-COCO dataset](http://cocodataset.org).
This project aims to provide a small subset of the original image captions translated into Spanish by humans annotators.
This subset is composed by 20,000 captions of 4,000 images (5 captions per image).

Along with the previous subset, there are other subsets of MS-COCO in machine translated Spanish and original English that
have been used along with the main subset to carry out [1].
